# PDF-manager
Automates the process of searching for your PDF's folder and makes it easier to open the file you want.

For the program to run correctly, you must create a folder (or use an existent one) to put in all your PDF files you want to manage. Copy the path and paste like the example in the code, put it inside the commas ("") just like the example, after doing this you can just run it using any python debbugger, and now you don't need to waste time searching for folders or PDF files you want to open.
